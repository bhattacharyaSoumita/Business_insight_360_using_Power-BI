# Business_insight_360_using_Power-BI

Situation:
Atliq hardware has become one of the fastest growing company in the Elcetronic Goods Market.While they grew substencialy in last few years,they had some bitter experience in Latin America.They tried to establish their presence there,to open their new store but they faced a huge loss there.And this happens because they made all their decisions just based on the survey they conducted and just based on their intutions.In the annual strategy meeting one of the top item was to onboard Data Analytics in the company to make data driven decision.
Previously they were using Excel files,they were using some analysis in the excel itself but now the company is so big that Excel is not going to work anymore.

So they have hires data analytics team and they have assigned a task to the team to onboard data analytics and to bring lot of transparency into their data so that they can make accurate decisions.

In this project I have imported data from MySQL, connecting  with Power BI.
Snowflakes schema has been used in this project to connect the tables and manage the relationship.
This project is a dynamic presentation of Business Insights 360.
Finance View, Sales View, Marketing View, Supply Chain View has been covered here using the use case of AtliQ Hardware.
